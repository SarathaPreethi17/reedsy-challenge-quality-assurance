You should:

 include simple instructions for running the tests, including installing any tools
 write failing tests for the two highest priority bugs
 explain why these are the highest priority bugs
 write a passing test for a working feature
 explain why this passing test is worthwhile
 write robust, maintainable tests
 should not rely on the test environment having stable data

You may:  use any automated testing tools you like

Automation Script 1:

Description/Summary: When searching for the exact title of a book in the search field, no results are displayed.

Why This is a High-Priority Bug? 
This defect is considered a critical, high-priority bug for several reasons:

* Search is a fundamental and expected feature of any application dealing with a collection of items (like books). 
* If users cannot find items by their exact title, the primary purpose of the app is severely undermined.
* Users expect search to be reliable and accurate.
* When an exact match yields no results, it leads to significant frustration, distrust in the application, and a perception of the app being broken or incomplete. 
* Even if books are correctly stored in the database,a broken search mechanism makes them effectively inaccessible to the user.
* This negates the value of having the book data in the first place.
* If users cannot easily find what they're looking for, they are likely to abandon the application.
