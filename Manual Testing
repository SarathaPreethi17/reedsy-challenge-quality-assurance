Defect 3: Navigation Issue – Missing Back Button
Description/Summary: When clicking on any book, the system navigates to the book details page. However, there is no back button to return to the original list/search results page.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Perform a search or browse the list of available books.
3.Click on any book to view its details.

Test Environment: QA
Test Device: Chrome browser, Desktop version
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Defect 4: Sort Functionality – Incomplete Options / Incorrect Logic
Description/Summary: 
The "ID" sort option appears in the sorting dropdown, but sorting by ID is not meaningful or useful in a user-facing context.
It seems to reflect an internal system identifier rather than something relevant to users. This may be a design flaw or an unnecessary option unless explicitly intended for administrative use.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Navigate to the book listing or search results page.
3.Open the sort dropdown.
4.Select the "ID" sorting option.

Expected Behavior:
Sorting options should be relevant and meaningful to end users, such as sorting by Title, Author, Published Date, or Rating. If ID is included,
it should be clearly explained or reserved for admin-only views.

Actual Behavior:
The sort dropdown includes "ID" as a sorting option, which is unclear and not useful to general users. It may confuse users who do not understand the purpose of internal IDs.
Test Environment: QA
Test Device: Chrome browser, Desktop version
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Defect 5: UI/UX issues:
Description/Summary: 
When a search yields no matching results, the page does not display a user-friendly "No results found" message. 
Instead, it shows a blank or empty state, which can confuse users and lead them to believe the search is broken.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Navigate to the search field.
3.Enter a random or non-existent book title (e.g. xyz123book).
4.Observe the search results page.

Expected Behavior:
If no matching books are found, the application should display a clear and friendly message such as "No results found", 
possibly with suggestions (e.g., "Try a different keyword" or "Check your spelling").

Actual Behavior:
When the search returns no matches, the page is blank with no indication that the search completed or that no results were found.
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Defect 6: UI/UX issues:
Description/Summary:
The search input field is visible at the top of the page in the Bookshelf app, but it lacks a search icon or placeholder text. 
This may confuse users, as it's not immediately clear that the field is for searching, reducing usability and discoverability.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Observe the top section of the page where the search input field is located.
3.Note the absence of a search icon or label within or near the field.
4.Attempt to interact with the field without clear context.

Expected Behavior:
The search input field should include a search icon (e.g., a magnifying glass) and/or placeholder text like "Search for books..." to clearly indicate its purpose to the user.

Actual Behavior:
The search input field is present but has no icon or label, making it unclear to users that it is intended for entering search queries.

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Defect 7: Missing Images on Page 2 of Book Listings
Description/Summary:
While all book images load correctly on page 1 of the book listings in the Bookshelf app, some images are missing or broken on page 2. 
This results in an inconsistent user experience and may lead users to believe the content is incomplete or the application is malfunctioning.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Navigate to the book listings or search results.
3.Scroll to or navigate to page 2 of the listings.
4.Observe the book thumbnails/images displayed.

Expected Behavior:
All book images should load correctly and consistently across all pages of the book listings, including page 2 and beyond.

Actual Behavior:
On page 2, some book images are missing or appear broken, while all images display correctly on page 1. This creates a perception of incomplete or poor-quality data.

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Defect 8: Missing Total Page Count in Pagination Footer
Description/Summary:
The pagination footer in the Bookshelf app does not display information such as "Page X of Y". Without this, 
users cannot tell how many pages of content exist or how far they are into the listing, leading to poor navigation and user experience.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Navigate to the book listings or search results page.
3.Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the pagination controls.
4.Observe the pagination footer and available information.

Expected Behavior:
The pagination section should display the current page number and the total number of pages, e.g., "Page 2 of 10". This gives users clear context about their position in the dataset.

Actual Behavior:
The pagination only shows numbered pages, but does not indicate the total number of pages (e.g., “Page 2 of X”), leaving users uncertain about the scope of content.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Defect 9: Page 0 Displayed – Logical Inconsistency in Pagination
Description/Summary:
The pagination system in the Bookshelf app displays "Page 0", which is not standard in user-facing applications. Pagination typically starts from Page 1. Displaying Page 0 creates a logical inconsistency and may confuse users, as it's unclear whether it indicates an error, an empty state, or a misconfiguration.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Navigate to the book listings or search results page.
3.Observe the pagination controls at the bottom of the page.
4.Note the current page indicator or the first page in the sequence.

Expected Behavior:
Pagination should start from Page 1, following common conventions. Users should see "Page 1", "Page 2", etc., with no reference to "Page 0".

Actual Behavior:
The application displays "Page 0" as the starting page, which is non-standard and confusing to users. It may also suggest a potential issue in the pagination logic.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Defect 10: Page 0 Accessible via Pagination – Invalid Page Navigation
Description/Summary:
Although the Bookshelf app correctly launches on Page 1, clicking the "<" (Previous) button in the pagination footer from Page 1 navigates the user to Page 0, which should not exist. This is a logical and usability defect, as user-facing pagination should never expose or allow access to a non-existent Page 0.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Confirm that the book listing starts on Page 1.
3.In the pagination footer, click the "<" (Previous) button while on Page 1.
4.Observe the page number and content.

Expected Behavior:
When on Page 1, the "<" (Previous) button should be disabled or non-functional, preventing navigation to any page before Page 1.

Actual Behavior:
Clicking the "<" (Previous) button on Page 1 takes the user to Page 0, which is not a valid or standard page and results in confusion or potentially empty/erroneous content.

 Even if they're not strictly bugs, flag any parts of the UI/UX that feel like they could be improved, and provide a possible suggestion:

Defect 1:  Missing Sort Options – "Newest" / "Bestselling" / "Popularity"
Description/Summary:
The Bookshelf app's sort functionality lacks commonly expected sorting options such as "Newest", "Bestselling", or "Popularity". 
These are standard in most book-related applications and enhance user experience by helping users discover trending or recent content. 
Their absence limits how effectively users can browse the catalog.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Launch the Bookshelf app in a browser.
2.Navigate to the book listing or search results page.
3.Open the sort dropdown 
4.Review the available sorting options.

Expected Behavior:
The sort dropdown should include commonly used options like: Newest (by publication date),Bestselling,Most Popular or Most Viewed.
These help users quickly find relevant or trending books.

Actual Behavior:
The sort dropdown only includes basic or limited options (e.g., "Title", "ID", "Author", "Rating"), and lacks important filters like Newest, Bestselling, or Popularity,
reducing the effectiveness of search and discovery.
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

No Direct Page Selection/Jump: Users cannot jump to a specific page (e.g., Page 1, Page 5, Page 10) directly. This forces sequential navigation, which is inefficient for many pages.

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

No "Next/Previous" Labels: While < and > are present, explicit "Previous" and "Next" text or clearer buttons are standard for usability.
