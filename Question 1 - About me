Tell us briefly (2-5 paragraphs) about your experience testing a commercial project.

During my recent role at Dnata Travel (Emirates Group), I was deeply involved in testing a large-scale commercial project within the Airlines domain. This project required validating critical booking flows, chatbot integrations, and CMS-driven content updates across multiple environments. I was responsible for both manual and automated testing across various touchpoints, ensuring the product met high-quality standards across functionality, performance, and visual consistency. I developed a robust test automation framework from scratch using C# .NET 8.0, Selenium, and SpecFlow under a BDD approach, enabling seamless integration into the CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps. This automation significantly reduced the overall manual regression testing effort, cutting down testing cycles by several days while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

One of the key aspects of the project involved validating a React-based user interface across devices and browsers, where I conducted detailed pixel-perfect validation against Figma designs using tools like BrowserStack. I also collaborated with developers, product owners, and UX teams in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to align testing efforts with business objectives. Using Postman and Swagger, I ensured robust API validation, while also managing test environments, data setups, and production sanity checks through JIRA and Azure DevOps workflows. Early defect detection through these thorough validations helped reduce production issues, improving overall product stability.

In an earlier e-commerce project with Global Intelligent Consultancy Ltd, I led testing of a dynamic shopping platform, building automated regression packs using Java, Selenium, and Cucumber BDD. I also performed accessibility testing using Lighthouse and WAVE, helping the team proactively address critical WCAG issues before release. My efforts contributed significantly to reducing production defects and improving the overall user experience.

These experiences have honed my ability to handle both technical depth and business-critical functionality, ensuring that deliverables meet expectations in fast-paced, Agile environments. I take pride in bridging the gap between development and quality assurance, and consistently delivering value through structured test planning, exploratory testing, and continuous process improvement. By introducing automation, I was able to streamline regression cycles, reduce manual testing days, and catch defects early in pre-production environments, which collectively minimized production risks and enhanced release confidence.
